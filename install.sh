#!/usr/bin/env bash

# This script will install the dotfiles on the current machine.
#
# It expects the dotfiles to be located in the `~/.dotfiles` directory. It will
# also create a `~/.dotfiles.bak` directory where it will backup existing
# dotfiles before removing them (note, however, that only files and directories
# are backed up; symlinks or other types of files are not backed up).
#
# If the backup of a specific file fails, it will be interactively removed. If
# removal is denied, that specific dotfile will not be installed.
#
# Every dotfile in the home directory is replaced with a symlink to the file in
# the `~/.dotfiles` directory.
#
# If setup for certain files fails at first attempt, you may fix the issues
# manually and then run this script again. Since it only backs up files and
# directories, it will not overwrite previous backups with the created symlinks,
# will relink the old symlinks to the ~/.dotfiles correspondents and attempt to
# install the previously failed files once again.
#
# The `.extras` file is not installed. It should mostly contain local settings,
# like exporting JAVA_HOME from a specified installation directory. You may wish
# to manually copy this file to `~/.extras` and customize it accordingly.
#
# After installing the dotfiles, it will attempt to install required packages by
# various configurations, such as vim plugins.
#
# It will also attempt to compile and install the vim `YouCompleteMe` plugin.
